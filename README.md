# Kaggle Projects  

This folder contains my solutions to several Kaggle competitions.  
The projects demonstrate my skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using different ML libraries.  

## Projects  

- **Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster**  
  - Task: Binary classification (predicting survival).  
  - Approach: Data cleaning, feature engineering, logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting.  

- **House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques**  
  - Task: Predicting housing prices (regression).  
  - Approach: Feature selection using correlation, regression models, CatBoost, cross-validation.  

- **Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets**  
  - Task: Text classification (disaster vs. non-disaster tweets).  
  - Approach: Preprocessing text, TF-IDF features, logistic regression baseline, fine-tuning Transformers (HuggingFace).  

## Tech stack  
- Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib  
- scikit-learn, CatBoost, PyTorch, Transformers (HuggingFace)

These projects are part of my learning path in Data Science and show how I apply ML techniques to real-world tasks.
